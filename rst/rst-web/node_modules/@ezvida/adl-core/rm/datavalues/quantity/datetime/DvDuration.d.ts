/**
 * Represents a period of time with respect to a notional point in time, which is not specified.
 * A sign may be used to indicate the duration is backwards in time rather than forwards.
 *
 * NOTE: a deviation from ISO8601 is supported, allowing the W' designator to be mixed with other designators.
 * See assumed types section in the Support IM.
 *
 * Used for recording the duration of something in the real world, particularly when there is a need a) to represent the duration
 * in customary format, i.e. days, hours, minutes etc, and b) if it will be used in computational operations with date/time quantities,
 * i.e. additions, subtractions etc.
 *
 * Misuse: Durations cannot be used to represent points in time, or intervals of time.
